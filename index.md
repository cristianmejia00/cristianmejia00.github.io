## Researcher and academic entrepreneur

I analize networks of patents and academic articles to leverage funding allocation strategies. I also apply artificial intelligence / machine learning to connect large corpus of news to scientific research to better understand the social impact of emerging technologies.

Beyond the University I act as CTO and co-founder of [Paper Digest](https://www.paper-digest.com/) a web app that applies artificial intelligence to summarize academic literature. Aiming to accelerate the discovery process or just plainly free-up time to researchers.
